    "text": "Preface\nThe course ‚ÄúMathematical Modeling‚Äù has a dual purpose: on one hand, to introduce students to some basic mathematical models in various areas of biology (demography, ecology, infectious diseases, enzyme reactions, physiology, molecular networks); on the other hand, to provide fundamental knowledge in the analysis and numerical simulation of ordinary and partial differential equations.\nSpecifically, the first part of the course is dedicated to modeling using ordinary differential equations and introduces various analytical techniques (linearization, equilibria and their stability, bifurcation, regular and singular perturbations).\n\nOverview of ordinary differential equations (ODEs): Solution of linear equations; equilibria and linearized stability; phase plane, limit cycles; numerical schemes for solving ODEs.\nOne- or two-dimensional models in demography, ecology, epidemiology, and immunology. Non-dimensionalization of variables and parameters.\nSlow-fast systems, enzyme reaction models and their simplification using perturbative methods.\nBifurcation of equilibria and application to predator-prey systems and molecular networks. Simplified models of important biological phenomena, such as the cell cycle and glucose-insulin oscillations.\nExcitable systems: Hodgkin-Huxley equations (overview) and FitzHugh-Nagumo equations.\nParameter estimation for differential models.\n\nIn the second part, partial differential equation models and some techniques for constructing or approximating solutions will be studied. Additionally, some of the most interesting phenomena of reaction-diffusion equations (traveling wave solutions, Turing mechanism) will be presented in a biological context (morphogenesis).\n\nDynamical systems on networks. Examples in epidemiology.\nIntroduction to partial differential equations (PDEs): Solutions by separation of variables. Fourier series. The heat equation and Brownian motion. Eigenfunctions of the Laplacian. Numerical approximation.\nSkellam and Fisher equations: Waveform solutions; stationary solutions of the boundary value problem.\nStability of stationary solutions of reaction-diffusion systems and Turing‚Äôs mechanism for morphogenesis.

    "text": "1.1 The bathtub üõÅ model\nThe models of Newtonian physics are made of differential equations built starting from the second law of the dynamics. The structure of the models discussed here is instead simpler; they are based on the ‚Äúbalance equation of the bathtub‚Äù: if \\(Q(t)\\) is the quantity of a substance in the bathtub we have \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}t} = Q'(t) = I(t) - O(t),\n\\]\nwhere\nTo be more precise, the assumption is that, if \\(I_{(t,t+\\Delta t)}\\) is the quantity that enters in the interval \\((t,t+\\Delta t)\\), we have \\(I_{(t,t+\\Delta t)} = I(t)\\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)\\), where \\(o(\\Delta t)\\) is a higher order infinitesimal than \\(\\Delta t\\). Hence: \\[\nI(t) = \\lim_{\\Delta t\\to 0} \\frac{I_{(t,t+\\Delta t)}}{\\Delta t}.\n\\]\nThe input rate \\(I(t)\\) is like an instantaneous velocity: the quantity entered in a given time, when that time becomes very small. Hence \\(I(t)\\) is measured in \\([C][t^{‚àí1}]\\) units where \\([C]\\) represents the concentration of the quantity \\(Q\\). Similarly for the exit rate \\(O(t)\\).\nLet us start from a very simple example. Assume \\(I(t) = \\Lambda\\) constant input flux; \\(O(t) = \\gamma Q(t)\\), i.e.¬†exit flux is proportional to the quantity present at the moment; the proportionality constant \\(\\gamma\\) is often called the exit rate and has the dimension \\([t^{‚àí1}]\\), the inverse of time. From these assumptions we get: \\[\nQ'(t) = \\Lambda - \\gamma Q(t),\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\nsupplemented with some initial condition \\[\nQ(0) = Q_0.\n\\]\nThe solution is: \\[\nQ(t) = e^{-\\gamma t} Q_0 + \\frac{\\Lambda}{\\gamma}\\Bigl( 1 - e^{-\\gamma t} \\Bigr).\n\\]\nNote that if \\(\\Lambda = 0\\) (no input), the solution is simply \\[\nQ(t) = Q_0 e^{-\\gamma t}.\n\\]\nThis means that the survival time of a molecule initially present follows the exponential distribution: \\[\n\\mathbb{P}[\\text{a molecule present at time 0 is present at time $t &gt; 0$}] =\n\\frac{Q(t)}{Q_0} = e^{-\\gamma t}.\n\\]\nFrom the properties of the exponential distribution, we obtain that the mean survival time \\(\\mathbb{E}[T] = 1/\\gamma\\); hence the exit rate \\(\\gamma\\) can be interpreted as the inverse of the mean survival time.\nTo be more precise, let us define a continuous random variable \\(T\\), which measures the lifetime of a particle present in the bathtub. Then, the cumulative distribution \\(F(t)\\) of \\(T\\) is given by \\[\n\\begin{split}\nF(t) &= \\mathbb{P}[T \\le t] \\\\\n&= 1 - \\mathbb{P}[T &gt; t] \\\\\n&= 1 - \\mathbb{P}[\\text{a molecule present at time 0 is present at time $t &gt; 0$}] \\\\\n&= 1 - e^{-\\gamma t}.\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nSo, we indeed have an exponential distribution. The probability density function is: \\[\nf(t) = F'(t) = \\gamma e^{-\\gamma t},\n\\]\nand the expectation is: \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\int_0^\\infty t f(t) \\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{1}{\\gamma}.\n\\]",

    "text": "1.2 Malthus equation\nThe metaphor of the bathtub can be used to model the dynamics of a population. Neglecting all differences among individuals (due to age, sex, genetic,‚Ä¶) we can represent a population through its size \\(N(t)\\); this will increase through inputs due to births and outputs due to deaths (if immigration and emigration are not considered). Hence \\[\nN'(t) = B(t) - D(t),\n\\]\nwhere \\(B(t) = \\text{births}\\) and \\(D(t) = \\text{deaths}\\).\nMalthus model assumes\n\nwithin a (short) time period of length \\(\\Delta t\\), each individual gives, on average, birth to \\(\\beta\\Delta t\\) new individuals; hence \\(B(t) = \\beta N(t)\\);\nwithin the same time period \\(\\Delta t\\), each individual has probability \\(\\mu\\Delta t\\) of dying; hence \\(D(t) = \\mu N(t)\\).\n\nWe get the following equation \\[\nN'(t) = \\beta N(t) - \\mu N(t) = (\\beta - \\mu)N(t),\n\\]\nthat represents the Malthus model. The parameter \\(\\beta\\) is known as fertility rate, while \\(\\mu\\) is the mortality rate. Finally, \\[\nr = \\beta - \\mu\n\\]\nis the (instantaneous) growth rate and is also called Malthus parameter or biological potential of the population.\nWith the initial condition \\[\nN(0) = N_0,\n\\]\nthe evolution of the population is completely determined. In fact, the solution is \\[\nN(t) = N_0 e^{rt},\n\\]\nand we see that the population will go to extinction or will grow without limits if \\(r &lt; 0\\) or \\(r &gt; 0\\), respectively. If instead \\(r = 0\\), the population size is constant (births and deaths compensate.)\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nsns.set_theme(\"notebook\", style=\"whitegrid\")\nt = np.linspace(0,1,100)\n\nplt.plot(t,np.exp(1*t),label='r &gt; 0')\nplt.plot(t,np.exp(-1*t),label='r &lt; 0')\nplt.plot(t,np.exp(0*t),label='r = 0')\nplt.grid()\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel('Time')\nplt.ylabel('Population')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of solutions of Malthus equation",
